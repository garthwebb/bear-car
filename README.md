# Bear Car

Bear car is an art car project brought to Burning Man in 2015 ([photos](https://photos.app.goo.gl/hQNxJEHgqHZzFq1y2)), meant to look like
[rilakkuma](http://www.san-x.jp/characters/rilakkuma.html), the lazy bear.

It consists of two Huffy beach cruiser bikes that are bolted together.
A linkage in front connects the two bicycles steering columns in an Ackermann steering geometry.  The bicycles are driven by two 350W electric
motors via a chain to the rear wheels.  Two people can ride in the car, who's top speed is around 15mph and can drive for around 2 hours on a charge.

An LED controller connects to a WiFi router that allows an iPhone running [L.E.D Labs](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/l-e-d-lab/id832042156)
to connect and control the dome lights.
